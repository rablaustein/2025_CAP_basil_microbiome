# 2025_CAP_basil_microbiome

Oxidative species generated by cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) can impact the plant stress response system. CAP was applied to live sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum var. Kiera) and treatment intensity effects on the leaf-associated microbiota as a factor of leaf distance from treatment were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Scripts and data that may be used to reproduce our analysis are provided here.
